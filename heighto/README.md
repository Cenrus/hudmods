# TF2 Heighto Hud

### Installation
1. Place this folder inside your `tf/custom` folder
2. Edit your hud's `scripts/hudlayout.res` file and add `#base "../resource/heighto_center.res"` at the top
> Or add it inside `resource/ui/hudplayerclass.res` instead, if you want it to show only when player is alive
